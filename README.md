# Cryptography I - Stanford University (Dan Boneh) - Coursera

Solutions of weekly assignments to practice Rust.

## Week 1: [Many Time Pad][w1]

Let us see what goes wrong when a stream cipher key is used more than once.  Below are eleven hex-encoded ciphertexts that are the result of encrypting eleven plaintexts with a stream cipher, all with the same stream cipher key.  Your goal is to decrypt the last ciphertext, and submit the secret message within it as solution.
