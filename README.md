# Cryptography I - Stanford University (Dan Boneh) - Coursera

Solutions of weekly assignements to practice Rust.

## Week 1: [Many Time Pad][week_01-many_time_pad]

Let us see what goes wrong when a stream cipher key is used more than once.

Your goal is to decrypt the last ciphertext, and submit the secret message within it as solution.
